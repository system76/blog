Magnetic assembly seemed to be a good idea. We went from trying to glue magnets in to doing what’s called press fitting. The bars come right out of powder coating while they’re nice and warm, when the aluminum is slightly larger than when it cools down. Those magnets aren’t actually adhered to anything in the bars; they’re squeezed in nice and tight from the aluminum cooling and contracting around them. That’s called a press fit, and doing that makes the process faster and less expensive.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"It’s similar with the bottoms of Launch; we have steel plates that we press fit into that part as opposed to gluing or screwing, but that we do before powder coating; steel rusts, and we don’t want someone opening up their keyboard in a year and finding a little bit of rust floating underneath their super high-end PCB. So we do that, sand it down, use our media blaster to clean off the surface from the tool paths you see from the mill, and then we powder coat it through and through.",spans:[]},{type:d,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fblog-system76\u002Fa84e720c-c4fe-4f4d-9d39-694436200eaa_tumblr_5df69d0d3cfa0370f1786dae4a772091_844eb61e_1280.jpg?auto=compress,format",alt:b,copyright:b,dimensions:{width:g,height:w}},{type:a,text:"Word on the Denver streets is that Thelio Major is getting a redesign soon.

The NVIDIA 3000-series cards are almost a pound heavier in some instances, and that’s a lot of weight to be shipping across the country.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"We also want to continue to make Thelio Major cooler and quieter when it’s running with these new GPUs. Our new brake press allows us to make radius bends on parts, so we’re starting to run through R&D of a laser-welded external. It’s a wholesale departure from us using custom brackets and 3M VHB tape.
