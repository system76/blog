The important things.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"Take a moment to describe the different functions of the Sales Team.",spans:[{start:c,end:68,type:d}]},{type:a,text:"The  Sales Team itself is currently made up of two different positions. The  Customer Experience Specialist (CES) is the first line of conversation  with System76 with regards to anything order-related. Their job is to  make your process from purchase to shipment as easy as possible and  provide you with as much information as you might need, such as giving  status updates about orders or answering questions that may have arisen.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"The  other position within Sales is Account Management. They’re the people  you talk to from first inquiry to System76 about products. These guys  help anyone, from my 80-year-old grandma who’s looking to transition  from Windows to Linux, to Fortune 50 companies. They deal with a wide  variety of customer base, so they’re pretty much experts in getting the  customer what they need.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"Then there’s the Product Management side  of Sales. The Product Manager stays up to date on all-new technology,  and then informs and directs the team. The position was built to ensure  System76 is at the forefront of new and exciting technologies, whether  that’s within the Thelio product line or in the form of updates that  come to our laptops. And that could be as simple as tracking memory  updates from DDR4 to DDR5, or with PCIe 3.0 updating to PCIe 4.0. For  things like that we’ll track and update products throughout their  lifetime.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"What is the guiding principle for how the System76 Sales Team operates?",spans:[{start:c,end:71,type:d}]},{type:a,text:"The  Sales Team philosophy we push is what I call, “Consultative Sales.”  We’re here to be an assistant to the user in order to get them the right  product for the job; we’re not going to upgrade you for the sake of  upgrading. The team is there to understand what you want to accomplish  so that they can get you the right machine with the optimal performance  for your use case.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"What factors into the decision to introduce a new product?",spans:[{start:c,end:58,type:d}]},{type:a,text:"There’s  quite a few factors internally that we’ll go through. Looking at our  product line we ask ourselves, is there something that’s missing from  it? And if we do find something, what are the benefits to it? How is it  going to make us as a company better, and us as a provider of  Linux-based technologies the right fit for our customers?",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"For the  Lemur Pro, battery life had always been a high-value item for our  customer base. Before the Lemur Pro and Darter Pro were introduced about  2 years ago, the average battery life on a System76 computer was about  3-5 hours. The ability to introduce a product with a higher battery  wattage allowed us to extend battery life almost threefold. That value  is really what drives a product forward. ",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"What is your team’s background with Linux?",spans:[{start:c,end:42,type:d}]},{type:a,text:"A  lot of the team members have a background in Linux as users. That’s  what we tend to typically hire and bring on. They are apt in review and  understanding, and helping customers that have specific tasks and needs  within the Linux environment. Charles was using Raspberry Pis in order  to do some cool things, and Bradley used Ubuntu even before he was  hired. The same can be said for Jeremy and John. They all believe that  Linux is the right tool for people, and they showcase that for incoming  customers. Even if they’re not tech-savvy within Linux, there’s a  background there with using it and seeing it in the wild.",spans:[]},{type:f,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fblog-system76\u002F2708714a-5b53-4d19-b776-79c5182b5a97_tumblr_0f699ce37ed7356f8f6bdc2e9beb6386_2a7d41f2_500.png?auto=compress,format",alt:g,copyright:b,dimensions:{width:h,height:199}},{type:a,text:"What challenges did the pandemic present when it first started?",spans:[{start:c,end:63,type:d}]},{type:a,text:"I  think at the very beginning, the biggest challenge for us was the loss  of the team camaraderie. A lot of Sales is personal relationships, and  the team feeds off of each other, so having everyone in the same area  was a huge benefit pre-pandemic.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"In the first month or so after it  started, there were definitely challenges with productivity and  communication because Sales works a lot with Engineering, Support, and  other departments in order to give the customers the information they  need to make an educated decision, or to update them on the status of  their order.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"But, I think one of the best tools we have is our  employee messaging client. That was already ingrained in us as something  that was used pre-pandemic that really started to show its value  post-pandemic, especially with the team members being in different  homes—and in some cases, different states. It allowed us to provide our  staff with as much as they needed to make their environment feel like  they were still in an office, still able to get the camaraderie, and  still able to get almost the same instantaneous response as they would  in the office, but now done remote.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"Our ability to put tech first,  especially within Sales and Service, is one of the things we do really  well. We never throw people at a problem. By that I mean we don’t  delegate a problem up the chain to solve it. Instead we work for a  solution, and our people evolve into that solution. From my viewpoint,  we’ve established that a remote environment is as productive as an  in-person environment, which has opened up the door for System76 to  grow. Instead of working within a local pool, we’ve now moved to the  ocean. Whereas you used to have to hire and work to provide resources  for new hires to move to Denver so they can work with the team, now we  can bring on team members from pretty much anywhere on the globe to come  help make System76 better. ",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"System76 has seen steady growth in  the past year despite drastic political and economic changes. What do  you attribute the success to?",spans:[{start:c,end:136,type:d}]},{type:a,text:"I think we’ve matured as an  organization. We have introduced products and product lines that are  meeting and exceeding a lot of different customer requirements. When I  look at our desktop line from when I started seven years ago, our  options were the Ratel, the Wild Dog, the Leopard, and the Sable. With  production moving in-house and the introduction of Thelio in the last  two and a half years, keeping in mind both Intel and AMD, we’ve gone  from offering a four-desktop solution to nine.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"Laptop and desktop  quality has also increased in the last seven years, and a lot of that  has to do with what we’ve done in our new manufacturing facility. We  have made leaps and bounds with regards to what we’re doing with  software engineering now. There’s a huge demand for what our Software  Engineering Team has done, driven by Jeremy and our open firmware\u002Fopen  EC that speak to a lot of people. Companies are looking at an open  source solution instead of proprietary because they want more control  over what their team and their organization are doing.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"One of the  things we’ve noticed is that our business clients have grown. There’s  significantly more support and drive from both the end user and the  corporate side to make it so Linux is a valued and desired solution for  their teams. Today, I can probably put a Windows 10 machine next to my  Pop!_OS 20.10 machine and accomplish everything in the same amount of  time or faster. Maybe I’m not using the same applications, but anything I  as a businessperson could do within Windows, I can now do with Pop!_OS  or Ubuntu. The Linux ecosystem is continuously changing, and that only  helps us as a company.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"You’ve been at System76 for quite a while. What’s it been like watching the company grow?",spans:[{start:c,end:89,type:d}]},{type:a,text:"It’s  amazing. When I started at the company, I was really the first  Sales-oriented person. I was the 8th employee at the time, and now I’m  the 5th-oldest employee of System76 out of over 50 employees. So it’s  huge, man.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"When you look at a lot of big corporations, change is  hard to make happen. It’s looked at as too different, too risky. But  here, change is really something we strive for. We work to be different,  to be new, to figure out new ways to help our customers or create  solutions to help them, or figure out ways that can change us for the  better that you just typically wouldn’t see from a corporation.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"What was your favorite moment?",spans:[{start:c,end:30,type:d}]},{type:f,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fblog-system76\u002F42ed6948-0638-477b-ace7-724a44da106b_tumblr_0981e5e5a96dbaee181333a25337184e_49786c32_500.png?auto=compress,format",alt:g,copyright:b,dimensions:{width:h,height:375}},{type:a,text:"When  I first looked at System76, back when we were only offering Ubuntu, I  saw the beginning of something very similar to another major player.  Very grassroots, very much specialized and hardware-specific. They also  created their own operating system, so when I interviewed in 2014, I  made comments during my interview with Carl that I expected us to  probably produce our own operating system as well. I thought that would  be our endgame as a company. At that time, and Carl might contradict my  memory on this, but I remember he didn’t think that would ever happen.  And then in October 2017, we released the first version of Pop!_OS. That  made everything come kind of full-circle for me.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"The following  year, we brought hardware inside in order to make it the best that we  could. So in three short years from me starting, we took what we were  doing and elevating it to something that only a handful of companies do,  and do well. Our potential is really limitless from what I’ve seen so  far, and it’s very apparent with what we’ve done with Pop!_OS since its  release, as well as where we’ve taken Thelio. I bet you we never thought  we would’ve implemented something like i3 tiling into Pop!_OS. I really  goes back to how we view change. We embrace it. We see it as trying to  do something better than we did before. Carl and the Engineering Team  view software as always being about revision, and we bring that  philosophy back to hardware and back to the company as a whole.",spans:[]}]},id:"post_copy$dbd1f45e-15ac-4688-a2a1-578e6a2d452c",slice_type:"post_copy",slice_label:b}],socialText:b,socialLinks:[{link:{}}],seoTitle:e,seoDescription:j,seoSocial:[{image:{dimensions:{width:1200,height:600},alt:b,copyright:b,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fblog-system76\u002Fd5d15270-45e2-4047-bcc1-e42db3eb9a15_salesteam.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,12,500,250&w=1200&h=600"},title:e,description:j}]}},_img:{}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("paragraph",null,0,"strong","Behind the Scenes of System76: Sales Team","image","Image",500,"behind-the-scenes-of-system76-sales-team","The System76 Behind the Scenes series aims to give readers an inside look at the people behind our mission.
