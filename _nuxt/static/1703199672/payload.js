For example, if the CPU isn't being utilized heavily, but the GPU is, then let's spin the GPU fans. If it's the CPU that's being used, not the GPU, let's use the CPU fan so we can reduce the number of fans running at higher speeds. ",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"With the balance of the overall system having cool air come in from different places, but without conflicting with each other, those fans can move at lower RPMs to cool the system.
