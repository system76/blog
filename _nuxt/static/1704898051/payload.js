I created a script that setup Arch for my system with all of my settings. I would test the script in a VM and tweak it until it just worked. At the time, I didn't know how to handle errors and edge cases, so it just brute forced it's way through the install process without any room for other settings or setups.

If you create websites, videos, music, or digital art in general, then you will most likely have tools that are command-line-based alternatives to your GUI application. Converting video formats to different sizes and bitrates can be done with a GUI, but there are also ffmpeg commands to accomplish the same thing. You can create a script that converts your videos to all formats and sizes that you will need for your work. The same can be said for digital images.

For example, if the CPU isn't being utilized heavily, but the GPU is, then let's spin the GPU fans.
