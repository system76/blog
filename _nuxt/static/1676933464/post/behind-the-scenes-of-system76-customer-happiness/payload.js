The H stands for Human. Instead of using scripts and sending out links  every time, we’ll put the actual solution in the ticket and we’ll greet  them with empathy and their name. We don’t have any automated things  happening in there. Nothing is robotic in tech support. Everything is  handled by a human.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"The A is for Active, meaning we keep the  tickets active until they’re resolved.

We don’t want to ask questions that aren’t relevant to the  case. We want to keep customers on the track of being productive as  well, so if they’re focused on voicing negativity, we try to steer the  conversation in a more productive direction to keep everyone focused on  reaching a solution.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"And then the Y is for You. We encourage  everyone on the team to be their nerdy selves, so if a customer mentions  something they love, they can chime in and nerd out with the customer  for a few minutes and have that little touch of their personality to the  call or to the ticket.

I think we have a  mix of really good products, incredible engineering, a QA team that  caught potential issues before shipping products, and a sales team that  provided the right information so the customer purchased the best  product for them.

The  individuality on the team is what makes it so fun!",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"I went to  school for journalism and worked for a couple newspapers.

The team has been doing a contest the past couple months,  and it is amazing how many tickets they can get one-and-done.

We were in an  office building, but we were actually starting to try to manufacture  things with a laser in this side room that had black curtains so no one  could see what we were doing in there. So all of us bunched into this  really small room and we popped champagne bottles and they were flashing  the USBs. They were all over the table. It was so cool.
