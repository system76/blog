This cosmic spectacle allows astronomers to peer deeper into the universe and uncover hidden cosmic treasures. Massimo uses the example of something known as a high redshift galaxy–i.e. when a galaxy is very far away, it’s very difficult to see. However, when that high redshift galaxy is situated behind a massive galaxy cluster, the gravity from the cluster deforms spacetime, changes the path of light and creates a natural telescope in the sky. This allows astronomers to observe objects in the distant universe that would otherwise be too faint or distant to detect, opening up new possibilities for studying early galaxies, exploring the history of the universe, and observing phenomena that would otherwise remain hidden.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:b,spans:[]},{type:e,text:"Sunburst Arc: A Cosmic Mirage",spans:[]},{type:o,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fblog-system76\u002F5eab4fe4-ea3b-4ecb-9c74-15b28350d3df_The_Sunburst_Arc_%2849047337303%29.jpg?auto=compress,format",alt:p,copyright:c,dimensions:{width:n,height:1143},id:"ZRRKRRIAACoA9LD1",edit:{x:d,y:d,zoom:j,background:q}},{type:a,text:"When we first met with Massimo, the Sunburst Arc in particular was of great interest to him.

And because it was exceptionally bright, it meant that you could get very high quality astronomy data.
