We're a privately held software company, and our focus has been really the transport of a variety of different things across IP networks. So that could be media and entertainment content, like streaming services that you would watch. We can provide a transport, and we have a product for that called SG-MDRN, which stands for media data, real time networking. And then we also have a transfer product, which we call SG-X. And that's for when you have a need to move large, complex data sets from one part of the planet to another. That's where we have leveraged the streaming methodology to be able to move those kinds of data volumes. And then the last one, which is where System76 is really helping us out a lot, is in an area of interactive or immersive experiences. Some people are calling them like spatial commerce, where you could go to a website and be able to purchase goods, but you're doing it through like a virtual storefront where maybe you're building an avatar or you're going to buy a Ferrari and you're going to configure exactly what color you want and you can get into the driver's seat and your salesperson might be sitting in the passenger seat.",spans:[{start:c,end:1216,type:e}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Using System76 GPU Servers",spans:[{start:c,end:26,type:g}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Brandon: Where we use System76 servers in that instance with GPUs that are loaded in them, puts us in a position to be able to respond to the scale demand that customers would have while being able to have a global footprint across our data center. So we're a small company headquartered in the Atlanta, Georgia area, and I've been with a company for about three and a half years. I joined in the summer of 2020. And my responsibility and role is I'm the head of strategy, the chief revenue officer. So everything, sales and marketing kind of rolls up through me too. If we focus on exactly where System76 is helping, it's in that SG-RT product and RT standing for real time. We have a baseline software foundation that enables what's called pixel streaming. Okay, so if you think about the game engines that are available in the market today, Unreal Engine is the market leader. There's another company called Unity. And when you think about video game development, you're now starting to see that move into other forms of content, right? Whether it's corporate training or the spatial commerce that we talked about, it could be content management solutions. And so people use unreal engine or unity to be able to create this immersive content. But what you want to do to make sure it gets to the most broad audience is that you don't want to have the end user to rely on their own device to have these really high photorealistic, high fidelity content, right? So what you do is you use a server infrastructure and then you stream the pixels from the game engine to the user's device, whether that's mobile desktop or VR headset, or even a game console. And so where System76 helps us is that they build out very specific custom servers because there's a real market demand and need for companies to be able to scale these experiences.",spans:[{start:c,end:1836,type:e}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Why use GPU Servers?",spans:[{start:c,end:l,type:g}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Brandon: So let's say that Nike is going to do a big campaign and they're going to drop some of these digital assets as part of a campaign. And they think that they could get 500,000 people to show up to check out this experience. The challenge is if you use cloud resources, like virtual machines that are assigning a GPU, you have a one to one relationship between that server and the GPU and the user. The average cost in the market today for cloud resources for that type of experience is a dollar per hour per user. So if Nike says, hey, we got a half a million people that can show up, well, you would actually have a cost of $500,000 an hour to deliver that experience using the pixel streaming offering in the market today. So what we've done with System76 is build out these high power servers with multiple GPUs in them. And then we've invented a way to be able to have multiple users on a single GPU. We call that GPU multi-tenancy. And so now instead of only one to one server to user, we actually can get on a dual GPU. We could get 18 users. So nine tenants per GPU. Well, that dramatically changes the unit economics so that these companies that want to have these really immersive, high fidelity photorealistic campaigns can actually achieve scale, because the data doesn't lie in terms of these users getting into these experiences. They spend a lot of time. I mean, you're cruising around looking at a variety of different products. Or maybe we're working with the Atlanta Braves, as an example. They created a digital twin of their baseball park here in Atlanta. And so if I'm a fan, I can run the bases. I can go to Q A with the front office or maybe some players. But you have to make sure you have both the hardware infrastructure and software to be able to deliver those kinds of experiences in a cost effective and reliable and performant way.",spans:[{start:c,end:1867,type:e}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"What is SG-RT?",spans:[{start:c,end:14,type:g}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Brandon: Instead of having to download a big file, for example, you're basically streaming the pixels of these experiences, right? So just imagine a car, and as you move around the experience, then the lighting and the shading, you want it to look as if you're right there and you're in it. And the only way that you're able to do that is if you pixel stream that actual content. And that's what SG-RT does. It creates the transport from the System76 server environment, right, where we've got that housed at a global footprint of data centers, and then pushes that to the user through just a browser like we're using today, or a mobile device, or a VR headset or whatever the end client device would be.",spans:[{start:c,end:704,type:e}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Where Streaming Global has the Most Impact",spans:[{start:c,end:42,type:g}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Brandon: When these kinds of experiences first came about, there was a use that's almost become a little bit of a taboo word out there now, which is metaverse. Right? And so there was a lot of different definitions of what the metaverse was, is, and could be. I think that when it first came out a few years ago, it was all about social spaces. And now what you're seeing is that there's some really great experiences that can be built with all of these tools, like unreal engine, unity. There's agencies that are spending all day, every day, building out this awesome, really impressive content. But then how can you best monetize that, right? You don't want just something that's really cool, but then you don't actually be able to point to how that helps your business. And so we're seeing a decent amount of use in that spatial commerce use case. Right? So I'm going into a virtual environment, maybe. I'm looking at the new campaign of Sephora, right? Sephora just released what's called the Sephora universe on a limited basis. So you could do, like, a virtual makeup try-on, as an example. You build an avatar, you're like, maybe this color would work, or whatever. ",spans:[{start:c,end:1173,type:e}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"But the automotive industry, we've seen a significant amount of investment in that. They're doing that in partnership with Epic Games. And because Epic Games owns Unreal Engine. And so instead of just going to a website today, and I kind of picked my model and I picked the color and maybe what the trim looks like, and it shows me a bunch of flat 2D pictures. Now I'm able to actually go into a virtual showroom. I'm walking around, I'm looking at all the different angles. I can step into the car, I can look at the trunk space. And so I still think that's kind of still in that spatial commerce type of use case, there's definitely going to continue to be a significant amount of investment in corporate training. And when you think about a large employee base, I mean, the example one that one of our strategic partners is working with today is Emirates Airlines. And so they have 100,000 employees, and they'll build out these training modules, whether it's for customer service staff or for flight attendants, or it could even be regulated types of training that's required for, say, maintenance or pilots.",spans:[{start:c,end:1112,type:e}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"And so we're seeing quite a bit of that. We were on a call last week where Target stores use unreal engine and build out these things when they're looking for the next season rollout of how they want to configure the store. So you're imagining and trying to determine what that customer experience is going to be. And then the content management one, I think, is really coming about. I mean, you see some of these consumer brands that if they'd like to have a real live view, rather than just go to an internal website and get a download of what the right kind of colors are for a particular campaign so that they can put that label on the outside of a drink. You're seeing people build those out in those game engines, like an unreal or unity, so that those agencies know exactly what it is that that end product will look like, rather than kind of guessing on what the vision would be. So those are the main use cases that we're seeing today for SG-RT.",spans:[{start:c,end:954,type:e}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Anticipating What’s to Come in Streaming Tech",spans:[{start:c,end:45,type:g}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Brandon: I think at the end of the day, as a software company, especially with a deep bench strength that we have in our engineering team, is you always need to be innovating. Right? I mean, the adage out there that always talked about the hockey player Wayne Gretzky, as to why he was a Hall of Famer and maybe the best to ever play the game is that he would always skate to where the puck was going to be rather than where it was. And I think as a software company and as a business, we're trying to anticipate where exactly that goes. And I think from a streaming standpoint, you can look at it in a couple of different ways. I mean, you can look at it as far as the streaming video, and we're all very familiar with that, whether it's using a platform like this for a podcast or Zoom on a conference call, or going to a Netflix or an Amazon prime to consume video. There's a variety of different kinds. But at the end of the day, you're just wanting to make sure that the customer experience is always better.",spans:[{start:c,end:1013,type:e}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"And is there an opportunity to be able to enhance that through add on technology? I mean, maybe know being able to have side by side streams, you're starting to see that with some of the sports sites today. And our job as a company is not. We don't do like the front end delivery or the monetization. We don't build products that would help customers monetize that. We integrate with those. But ours is to figure out how you go from that source of where the content lies to where the user needs to do it and how quickly and reliably and what's the best, not only performance, but visual quality that they can get. And I think consumers are just going to continue to demand that on the data side. And this is probably a two year old stat, but the comment was, every year the amount of world's data doubles. Right? So if I'm using these tools that enable me, because my computer, even though I just have a laptop, I can have terabytes of content, right? How do I actually move that content from the place where I'm working on it to where it needs to go from a business requirement standpoint?",spans:[{start:c,end:1090,type:e}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"And I think being able to have tools like that are really important. One thing that we're seeing and that we feel is a real opportunity for our company is that instead of services out there, which I would call a publish and pull model, like Dropbox, right, I can publish a file, but then the person that I want to have review it can go up and pull it, and there's some synchronization that happens there. I think you're going to see a lot more advancements in the streaming of data that will just make it that much more reliant. Not only reliable, but it'll basically stream just like you would stream a piece of video. And if you have a network hiccup or you lose connectivity, then to be able to make sure that it just picks up right where you left off, rather than having to restart it again.\n",spans:[{start:c,end:795,type:e}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"The Future of Immersive Content",spans:[{start:c,end:31,type:g}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Brandon: I think that maybe my parting shot would just be that it's really going to be fascinating to watch where this business goes in the next three to five years, specifically with that product line that we have, SG-RT. And is it going to be so much more commonplace that you have these immersive experiences rather than you and I just going to a website and seeing like a 2D photo like you would see on Amazon or whatever, and you're purchasing a product. How much more time is going to go by before we actually go into those kinds of experiences and you're trying something on virtually and you're creating an avatar that is right specific to your capabilities. And I know it's early days with generative AI, but I think it's only just going to make it that much more accurate so that hopefully we aren't in a position where we have to return items that don't fit or don't look like the way we thought they should when we purchased the item. And I also think that corporate training, customer training piece, there is so much data that suggests that the more that you interact with something, like maybe you set up a scenario where you are interacting with another person, even if it's an AI generated person, if that would just help you learn that much more the topic that you're working through. Rather than having to review a PowerPoint slide or even just listen to a speaker.
