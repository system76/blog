To solve for this, theme colors are automatically derived from the few base colors you can customize. For example, when you select a specific application background color, the system uses it to derive colors for other surfaces and text placed on those surfaces. When you choose a text tint color, the text colors automatically adjust to use this tint. Neutral tint color brings subtle tint into various widgets, including background and text in search input and tabs. To achieve this result we convert the selected custom color from sRGB to OKLCH and manipulate the color lightness value while keeping its hue and chroma values the same.",spans:[]},{type:i,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fblog-system76\u002Fb15af196-3dde-4204-9320-b535a633a8d1_image1.png?auto=compress,format",alt:j,copyright:a,dimensions:{width:p,height:q},id:"ZNaVPBIAACwAReHe",edit:{x:c,y:c,zoom:e,background:d}},{type:b,text:f,spans:[]},{type:b,text:"Most of the calculations that happen in the background have been implemented, including customization of colors.
