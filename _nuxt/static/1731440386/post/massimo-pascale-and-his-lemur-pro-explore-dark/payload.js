This is what’s called gravitational lensing. When  you have a massive galaxy cluster, and somewhere behind that galaxy  cluster is another galaxy, the light from that galaxy can get deflected  due to the mass of that galaxy cluster.

So all of this  data that we’re using is publicly available, and we’re able to reference  other astronomers that studied it in their previous works, and see what  information we’re able to glean from the data and build off of that.

The parameters can be something like the orientation of a  specific galaxy, things like that. This can end up being a lot of  parameters, so I do a lot of shorter runs first on the Lemur Pro, which  Lemur Pro is a great workhorse for, and then I ssh into a supercomputer  and I use what I got from those shorter runs to do one really long run  to get an accurate estimate.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"We’re basically throwing darts at a  massive board that represents the different combinations of parameters,  where every dart lands on a specific set of parameters, and we’re  testing how those parameters work via a formula which determines what  the likelihood of their accuracy is.
