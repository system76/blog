How this historically has been done is sort of a blend of physics and knowledge. We don't fully understand why proteins like to adopt these particular shapes, but we see bonds often have these angles for some reason, so we’d think, “let's just make an energy term that says that they should be in those angles.” And that was all done primarily on CPU and a combination of poorly understood physics and poorly understood observations mixed together.
