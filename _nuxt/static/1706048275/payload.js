When I was in the air force, that was some of our dev machines were those I don't like dealing with some of their quirks. There's weird things when you're doing local development where if you're running containers, you have to have a vm behind the scenes. There's extra layers of networking or some other machine that you have to deal with. And it's nice to be able to hit the raw system.

And then Zarf can handle the initialization of a k three s cluster, your container registry, a git repository, and then any apps you want to install on top of it. So it can basically light an entire environment from not much. And then you can customize the init package and obviously your own packages as you need for whatever environment you're running in.

If you bring over executable files, it'll scan those too, and it'll bring all that stuff together so you don't have to do that manually. It supports package signing with six door cosign so you can have some cryptographic security around the packages you're bringing over. And then we also focus heavily on user experience and making it just a very simple process to create a package, initialize whatever cluster you're deploying into and then deploy packages, basically three commands. So Zarf package create, Zarf init, Zarf package deploy and you have everything up and running. And that's a big difference from rolling your own. A lot of people who are solving this problem, they're doing it with bash scripts or they're trying to manually edit manifests. Just an example of one of the problems you might run into is your image references will be likely pointing to different domains.\nIf you're pulling an image from Docker hub, say Nginx, and then you're trying to bring that over to an air gap, the domain docker hub is not likely to exist there. So how do you rewrite that? A lot of people would manually do that, but Zarf has an agent that it can deploy into the cluster that will handle all that stuff for you. So it does a lot of this sort of behind the scenes work to make what are traditionally online deployments work offline, seamlessly.",spans:[{start:bc,end:fC,type:p},{start:fC,end:fD,type:p},{start:fD,end:1625,type:p}],direction:i},{type:aE,text:"Platform One and Its Significance",spans:[],direction:i},{type:a,text:"Austen: Platform one is one of the things that's kind of near and dear to my heart. And honestly, several people at defense unicorns in particular. There was a lot of us that were around the inception and idea of that kind of effort taking off. And honestly, it was an effort that was built on the backs of several other, what the department of defense calls software factory efforts like Kessel Run that came before it. And there were others too. But I think it's probably important to start with the problem statement before what it was trying to do. What a lot of us had saw after serving for a decade or so, is that as we went to each stop along our transition to different programs, is that kind of what I mentioned earlier. What was typical is you would kick off the procurement process, which takes a long time in itself to buy something from a vendor, and you would get a blank VPC from Amazon Web services or some bare metal somewhere. And then the idea was, hire a team through a services contract from a known prime contractor and just start building the software from the secure OS layer and up.\nAnd what you realize is that takes 18 months or more to deliver any capability and millions of dollars. And when you look across these programs, now that kind of software has eaten the world. 80% of that tech stack was the exact same software, but it's 30 different vendors recreating the wheel every single time. And it's just an incredible amount of waste when it comes to both time and people's opportunity, cost of their intellectual ability, quite frankly, and also just straight up taxpayer dollars like invoicing and paying bills to these services contracts. And so Platform One, really, the idea of many people coming together was really a self formed team of many people across the country at the time while in active military service. And what we said is like, hey, instead of starting with 5% of a commodity of AWS or whatever else, why don't we try to commoditize like 80% to the tech stack, so that when you start a new program or you're migrating a program to the cloud or whatever it may be, you have 80% of the solution done. It's not 100% right, because there's too much customization kind of at certain layers of the tech stack, but it is 80% maybe instead of five.",spans:[{start:aS,end:fE,type:p},{start:fE,end:fF,type:p},{start:fF,end:2291,type:p}],direction:i},{type:aE,text:"Linux Foundation Training Course",spans:[],direction:i},{type:a,text:"Austen: Rob Slaughter, our CEO, did a great job with this. I think what he realized is one of the greatest barriers of success for these it projects and national security is just lack of education. And that's not a knock against people at all, because the people making decisions are typically experts in business operations or procurement or even like these niche defense missions, right? Like literally putting weapons in a specific location at a specific time, or cyber operations or space operations. It's impossible to expect them to also be highly trained software engineering experts on Kubernetes, for example. And so how do you get them some level of top wave knowledge so that they understand the why behind things? So they can ask the right questions and contract the right products and services. And so what Rob kind of led the initiative was he partnered with Linux foundation to create a completely free course. And the link we had provided to you earlier, and I think it was even in the kind of document you sent out earlier today, so people can look on linuxfoundation.org and just search for \"devsecops for managers\" and it'll come up, it's completely free.\nBut it was really targeted for what I'll call those key stakeholders or decision makers that didn't normally come from a software background but find themselves building or acquiring or developing a system that is software native. And honestly, I think everybody on this call realizes that in today's world, any new endeavor is going to be a software defined endeavor. That's kind of where it starts and ends.

Lula does policy validation, which is useful for a process called authorizing a system and a risk management framework within the Department of Defense, but it's useful for the security compliance side of things.

For example, if the CPU isn't being utilized heavily, but the GPU is, then let's spin the GPU fans. If it's the CPU that's being used, not the GPU, let's use the CPU fan so we can reduce the number of fans running at higher speeds. ",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"With the balance of the overall system having cool air come in from different places, but without conflicting with each other, those fans can move at lower RPMs to cool the system.
