There's a big pent up demand for these things. There will be people that continue to build these things and contribute work on firmware and all these other things.

There's also, you know, there's a Japanese automaker, big Japanese automaker, who commissioned the development of this product for their autonomous driving team.

So most vehicle computers are like Raspberry PI class devices,  but how many hours to build Linux on a Raspberry PI? If you had to develop on that for a living, you'd go nuts. It would be too slow. So you've got to be able to develop and test at scale and deliver at scale. And this is a real challenge for the automakers. Using Ampere, using things like Thelio Astra on the desktop and system 76 Starling in the rack to be able to develop and test and deliver software at scale, being able to get the same silicon that automakers use today on clouds and put that on your desk- that's a really powerful thing.

You can stub it out, you can do 90 something percent of your test, but you actually, at some point you need physical hardware to do these things. If you're doing digital cockpits, infotainment and instrument cluster, there's real value in having a dozen virtual head units running on your desktop with Nvidia GPUs and being able to render it, capture it, stream it, share it with everyone in the office.

To make your cloud business work better and customers happier, and be more productive and profitable, and hit all your carbon green goals, you want more cores per rack and to use less power. So it's a density thing. Historically, a lot of the x 86 is all about scale up. Can I make the cores bigger, hotter, faster, more powerful? With arm, it's kind of more scaled out. If I can fit a large number of energy efficient cores per rack, that's good for the business, good for the environment, good for the bottom line. If these cores are fixed frequency, then they deliver predictable performance. If they have large private caches, then I don't have any. The hyper threading impacts and I can get good performance out of each of those cores. And then if I can put lots of those cores per socket and put lots of sockets per rack, that's the density.

That makes it easy to cool, it makes it good on your home power bill. It means that it makes it really easy to make it quiet. So now I can have Thelio. I can get Threadripper class performance out of a Thelio, but it's super quiet and not using much power. Pick a number. Let's say I want it to be 500 watts. If my cpu is using less power, then that means I can have more power for all the other things. So I can put hotter GPU's, more gpu's, and still keep within that same thermal and power limit. That's a really big thing. Also, there are folks where they get sticker shock that CPU's in the cloud with GPU's is hella expensive. So there is a lot of flight, not just in the home lab or in individual developers, but corporations and R + D teams and autonomous driving companies who end up shifting these things to the desktop and to racks in the office because they can rack and stack Ampere CPUs with Nvidia GPUs all day long for a fraction what it costs to do that in the cloud. ",spans:[],direction:a},{type:b,text:e,spans:[],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Why Thelio Astra?",spans:[{start:c,end:17,type:f}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"There is something to be said where if I need to physically touch the hardware or I need GPUs, there's not much that can beat that. Being able to do things like take a Thelio Astra and spin up 32 virtual four core mobile phone Socs or automotive ECUs car computers and be running tests in parallel, that has a huge impact on your ability to do more tests faster. Because you can parallelize it. And if you can do more testing faster, that's more turns of the wheel, more complete testing per day. So I move from once a week to once a night per pull request. I can do the full regression testing and that's just going to be awesome for all of these people. So incredibly excited to be doing this with you all.

So that could be media and entertainment content, like streaming services that you would watch. We can provide a transport, and we have a product for that called SG-MDRN, which stands for media data, real time networking. And then we also have a transfer product, which we call SG-X. And that's for when you have a need to move large, complex data sets from one part of the planet to another. That's where we have leveraged the streaming methodology to be able to move those kinds of data volumes. And then the last one, which is where system 76 is really helping us out a lot, is in an area of interactive or immersive experiences. Some people are calling them spatial commerce, where you could go to a website and be able to purchase goods, but you're doing it through a virtual storefront where maybe you're building an avatar or you're going to buy a Ferrari and you're going to configure exactly what color you want and you can get into the driver's seat and your salesperson might be sitting in the passenger seat.",spans:[{start:c,end:H,type:l}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Using System76 GPU Servers",spans:[{start:c,end:26,type:f}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Brandon: Where we use system 76 servers in that instance with GPUs and it puts us in a position to be able to respond to the scale demand that customers would have while being able to have a global footprint across our data centers.

We have a baseline software foundation that enables what's called pixel streaming. If you think about the game engines that are available in the market today, Unreal Engine is the market leader. There's another company called Unity. And when you think about video game development, you're now starting to see that move into other forms of content. Whether it's corporate training or spatial commerce that we talked about, or it could be content management solutions. People use Unreal Engine or Unity to be able to create this immersive content. But you want to make sure it gets to the broadest audience and not be reliant solely on the users’ devices in order to have photorealistic, high fidelity content. You use a server infrastructure and stream the pixels from the game engine to the user's device, whether that's mobile, desktop, a VR headset, or even a game console. Where system 76 helps us is they provide very specific custom servers because there's a real market demand and need for companies to be able to scale these experiences.",spans:[{start:c,end:1154,type:l}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Why use GPU Servers?",spans:[{start:c,end:Z,type:f}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Brandon: Let's say that Nike is going to do a big campaign and they're going to present immersive digital assets as part of a campaign. They estimate they could get 500,000 people to show up to check out this experience. The challenge is if you use cloud resources, like virtual machines that are providing a GPU, you have a one to one relationship between that server, GPU and the user. The average cost in the market today for cloud resources for that type of experience is one dollar per hour per user. If Nike believes a half a million people that can show up, it would actually have a cost of $500,000 an hour to deliver that experience using the pixel streaming offering in the market today. What we've done with System 76 is build out high power servers with multiple GPUs. Streaming Global has invented a way to have multiple users on a single GPU. We call that GPU Multitenancy. Now instead of only one server and one GPU per user, we actually can support 18 users on a server with two GPU’s, or nine tenants per GPU. That dramatically changes the unit economics so companies that want to provide an immersive, high fidelity photorealistic experience can actually achieve scale. The data doesn't lie in terms of these users getting into these experiences, spending a lot of time looking at a variety of different products. We're working with the Atlanta Braves, as an example. They created a digital twin of their baseball park here in Atlanta. So if I'm a fan, I can run the bases. I can go to Q & A with the front office or maybe some players.

Imagine a car configuration, and as you move around the experience, the lighting and the shading changes with your position. The manufacturer wants it to look as if you're in the showroom. And the only way to effectively accomplish that is to pixel stream thel content. And that's what SG-RT does. It creates the transport from the system 76 server environment, housed at a global footprint of data centers, and then pushes that to the user through just a browser, a mobile device, a VR headset or whatever the end client device would be.",spans:[{start:c,end:663,type:l}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Where Streaming Global has the Most Impact",spans:[{start:c,end:42,type:f}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Brandon: When these kinds of experiences first came about, they were categorized as as part of the metaverse. There was a lot of different definitions of what the metaverse was, is, and could be. It started out as all about virtual social spaces. And now there are some great experiences that can be built with all of these tools, like Unreal Engine and Unity. There are creative agencies hired by brands to build out this engaging, impressive content. But then how do you best monetize that content? You don't want just something that's engaging, but then you aren’t able to point to how that helps your business. We’re seeing significant activity in the spatial commerce use case. Sephora just released what's called the Sephora Universe on a limited basis. So a user could build an avatar and do a virtual makeup try on.",spans:[{start:c,end:9,type:l}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"In the automotive industry, we've seen a significant amount of investment in configuration experience. The manufacturers are doing that in partnership with the owner of Unreal Engine, Epic Games. Instead of going to a website today, and picking my model, color and trim with the site then showing the vehicle in a series flat 2D pictures, now I will be able to go into a virtual showroom. I'm navigating the space, I'm looking at all the different angles. I can step into the car, I can look at the trunk space. This is the spatial commerce use case. There’s also definitely going to continue to be a significant amount of investment in corporate training. When you think about a large employee base, one example is one of our strategic partners is working today is Emirates Airlines. The company has 100,000 employees, and they build out immersive training modules, whether it's for customer service staff or for flight attendants, or it could even be regulated types of training like maintenance or pilots.\nWe were on a call last week where Target stores use Unreal Engine to build store layouts when planning for the next season. You're imagining and curating the customer experience before any physical building begins. A last SG-RT use case is content management. Historically, consumer brands have gone to an internal website and downloaded the color schemes, or approved images and sounds of a particular campaign so they can appropriately label the item. Now you are starting to see agencies and companies build those out in game engines, like Unreal or Unity, so that those agencies know exactly what the end product will look like, rather than guessing on the original vision.

As a software company and as a business, we're trying to anticipate where exactly the market is headed.

This is probably a two year old stat, but the observation was every year the world's data doubles. How do I actually move that content from the place where I'm working on it to where it needs to go from a business requirement standpoint? Being able to have performant tools like that are really important. A real opportunity for our company is that instead of a user leveraging services that do a publish and pull model and there is synchronization that occurs, like Dropbox or OneDrive, you're going to see more advancements in the streaming of data that will increase performance and reliability. If you have a network hiccup or you lose connectivity, then being able to make sure that it just picks up right where you left off, rather than having to restart it again.\n",spans:[{start:c,end:1027,type:l}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"The Future of Immersive Content",spans:[{start:c,end:31,type:f}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"Brandon: My parting shot is that it's really going to be fascinating to watch where the immersive content business goes in the next three to five years, specifically with our product, SG-RT. It going to be commonplace that you have immersive experiences rather than seeing 2D photo on a website. How much more time is going to go by before we actually go into those kinds of experiences and you're trying something on virtually and you're creating an avatar that is specific to your measurements.\nI know it's early days with generative AI, but I think it's only just going to make it that much more accurate so that hopefully we aren't in a position where we have to return items that don't fit or don't look like the way we thought they should when we purchased them. Corporate training will leverage the data suggesting that the more that you interact with something the more apt you are to absorb it.

One thing to know is our genome doesn't just have genes, it has other non-coding elements that play an important role. One example of these is called enhancers.

There's been some really interesting work lately using deep learning to identify enhancers in an accurate mannerism.

The other thing is trying to understand how genetic variation within the enhancers has an impact. Sometimes the DNA changes and it does nothing. Sometimes it increases the number of copies of a DNA, sometimes it decreases it, but it's hard to predict.",spans:[],direction:a},{type:b,text:e,spans:[],direction:a},{type:b,text:"If we can build accurate machine learning models to do this, we can vastly speed up research and reduce costs, and study organisms that we can't study right now because it may be infeasible to do the actual experimental lab work for whatever reason.",spans:[],direction:a},{type:b,text:e,spans:[],direction:a},{type:k,text:"What are you most excited about for the future your field?",spans:[{start:c,end:58,type:f}],direction:a},{type:b,text:"I get really excited when I can understand the mechanisms of the biology.
