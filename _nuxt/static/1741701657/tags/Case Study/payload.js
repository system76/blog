I loved that I could apply my computing skills to understanding something in the real world. Data processing is interesting to me. I made it a focus in college, and then I went and got a PhD.",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:f,spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:"During college, while many of my colleagues were doing internships with companies, I was doing research with professors. I did spend a couple of years in industry after my PhD, so I was at Red Hat for two years. And then an online advertising company called Adroll for two years. I started my faculty position at the Milwaukee School of Engineering in fall 2018.\n",spans:[],direction:b},{type:h,text:"When along that journey did you discover Linux? Was it at Red Hat or was it before then?",spans:[{start:c,end:88,type:e}],direction:b},{type:a,text:"It involved Red Hat, but it was not while I was at Red Hat. In middle school, someone gave me a box copy of Red Hat Linux 6.2.\n",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:"I want to clarify, I did not omit the word enterprise. This was before it became Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This was old Red Hat. If I remember correctly, the version I had ran GNOME desktop version one.

We'll use a software package called GATK to try to identify where individual samples differ from a reference genome. We might also use a tool called MACS for what's called peak calling.",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:f,spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:"There's certain experiments that basically highlight certain parts of the genome that have activity of interest.

The data sets I work with have a lot of samples; the biologist will seek the DNA from a thousand mosquitoes. The ability to have 120 cores instead of 24 cores means I can process a lot more samples at once. It also tends to be very memory-intensive, so the fact that I can have 512 GB of ECC RAM is an important component of scaling up that pipeline. And these pipelines often take weeks to run, so it can cut it down from a month to a week or a few days.\n",spans:[],direction:b},{type:h,text:"What led to your decision to go with System76 and the Thelio Astra?",spans:[{start:c,end:67,type:e}],direction:b},{type:a,text:"I've been wanting an Ampere Altra system for a while.

It was time for an upgrade.",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:f,spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:"Whenever I would look at other systems with similar processors, I just couldn't get more cores or much more memory within my budget. The Ampere Altra platform offers a really nice price point for getting a lot of cores and a lot of RAM at the same time—and I need both to do my work. System76 was the only company I could find that was really supporting a workstation option for Ampere.\n",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:"I'm glad I went with System76 because support has been super helpful. I haven't run into any major problems. It's just my ignorance. I didn't realize that because it's running a server motherboard, it takes a really long time to post before the boot screen shows. I thought something was wrong with it when I got it, when it's like, why isn't this showing anything after five minutes? And it turns out I just needed to wait longer.",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:f,spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:"But the support was super helpful, and I really appreciate my interactions with the company.

And so one thing I had to figure out is that you have to pick a home field.\n",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:"In my particular case, I'm very comfortable teaching computer science and data science courses. Getting a PhD in computer science was the right fit for me, even if my research itself is very interdisciplinary. The trick is to basically find a faculty member who's working in bioinformatics who can advise students in a PhD program that you would be successful in.\n",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:"And for college students, you need to start talking to professors and seeing if you can get opportunities to do research with them in undergrad.

One thing to know is our genome doesn't just have genes, it has other non-coding elements that play an important role. One example of these is called enhancers. Enhancers help determine how many copies of the gene are produced, and we're actually just learning that a lot of diseases are caused not by changes in the gene themselves, but in the enhancers. So your body just may not produce as many copies of the gene.\n",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:"However, the enhancers are hard to find computationally. There's been some really interesting work lately using deep learning to identify enhancers in an accurate mannerism. Since it's finally pretty accurate, we could actually go through all the publicly available genomes of the NCBI database provided by the NIH and find the enhancers for all of them. And then that would allow us to do cross-species comparisons.",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:f,spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:"Another thing is that enhancers are generally not located near the genes they interact with. They're pretty far apart. So there's been some work to try to computationally determine which enhancers act on which genes, which will help us better understand what genes they impact and thus what potential diseases. The other thing is trying to understand how genetic variation within the enhancers has an impact. Sometimes the DNA changes and it does nothing. Sometimes it increases the number of copies of a DNA, sometimes it decreases it, but it's hard to predict.",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:f,spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:"If we can build accurate machine learning models to do this, we can vastly speed up research and reduce costs, and study organisms that we can't study right now because it may be infeasible to do the actual experimental lab work for whatever reason.",spans:[],direction:b},{type:a,text:f,spans:[],direction:b},{type:h,text:"What are you most excited about for the future your field?",spans:[{start:c,end:58,type:e}],direction:b},{type:a,text:"I get really excited when I can understand the mechanisms of the biology.
