A good portion of my work involves  designing, so I’m always in either Canva or Illustrator.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"I like  the ease of Canva because I can work on designs from my work laptop, or I  can use someone else’s laptop and log in if I’m somewhere else.

Let’s say I am  working on a poster, and I just started it, and I just want to keep  iterating on small changes. In order to do that, you have to locate the  artboard that you’re working on, and you can’t view them all on the  board at the same time. The reason I like Illustrator is I like to have  eight different artboards up at the same time, and I can zoom out and  see all my iterations at the same time, and then zoom into the one I  want to make changes on. That is my number one feature that I love about  Illustrator, and that’s what I want to bring to Designy.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"I’d also  give Designy the ability to create templates and share them with other  people on the same software. If you create a template, you can then put  it on the template board for other people to use. In Canva, you can’t  just put templates up in the marketplace. Canva creates your templates,  and those are the only ones you’re able to see unless you know somebody  who also uses Canva, and they send you the template to use.",spans:[]},{type:e,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fblog-system76\u002F72ceda18-a447-4358-8015-e2e4b482a5af_tumblr_5564116ae70aac5e2796e84b126be805_2809b1d9_500.jpg?auto=compress,format",alt:f,copyright:c,dimensions:{width:g,height:m},id:"Y0iA8BIAACgA_Tnl",edit:{x:b,y:b,zoom:h,background:i}},{type:a,text:"Do you have a background in coding?",spans:[{start:b,end:35,type:d}]},{type:a,text:"Not  really. In my last job I sent out all the emails for the organization,  and I also managed the website, so I did use HTML and CSS for that, but I  was never an expert in it.

I haven’t really  downloaded that much—I only really use Visual Studio Code and Firefox,  and I also downloaded the Brave browser on it—but I like the navigation.  I like that I can open up Visual Studio Code and then open up Firefox  and the auto-tiling will automatically arrange the windows.

It’ll also be up on GitHub, so people will be able to  push updates if they have a change they want me to make.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"I’m going  to finish the front end of the site in November and the back end of the  site will be done in January. The database connection will be done in  February. I know there may be a lot of weird bugs and whatnot that other  people will find, so the beta helps me work all that out.
