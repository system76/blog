And that's for when you have a need to move large, complex data sets from one part of the planet to another. That's where we have leveraged the streaming methodology to be able to move those kinds of data volumes. And then the last one, which is where system 76 is really helping us out a lot, is in an area of interactive or immersive experiences. Some people are calling them spatial commerce, where you could go to a website and be able to purchase goods, but you're doing it through a virtual storefront where maybe you're building an avatar or you're going to buy a Ferrari and you're going to configure exactly what color you want and you can get into the driver's seat and your salesperson might be sitting in the passenger seat.",spans:[{start:b,end:x,type:s}],direction:d},{type:a,text:"Using System76 GPU Servers",spans:[{start:b,end:am,type:k}],direction:d},{type:a,text:"Brandon: Where we use system 76 servers in that instance with GPUs and it puts us in a position to be able to respond to the scale demand that customers would have while being able to have a global footprint across our data centers.

We have a baseline software foundation that enables what's called pixel streaming. If you think about the game engines that are available in the market today, Unreal Engine is the market leader. There's another company called Unity. And when you think about video game development, you're now starting to see that move into other forms of content. Whether it's corporate training or spatial commerce that we talked about, or it could be content management solutions. People use Unreal Engine or Unity to be able to create this immersive content. But you want to make sure it gets to the broadest audience and not be reliant solely on the users’ devices in order to have photorealistic, high fidelity content. You use a server infrastructure and stream the pixels from the game engine to the user's device, whether that's mobile, desktop, a VR headset, or even a game console. Where system 76 helps us is they provide very specific custom servers because there's a real market demand and need for companies to be able to scale these experiences.",spans:[{start:b,end:1154,type:s}],direction:d},{type:a,text:"Why use GPU Servers?",spans:[{start:b,end:al,type:k}],direction:d},{type:a,text:"Brandon: Let's say that Nike is going to do a big campaign and they're going to present immersive digital assets as part of a campaign. They estimate they could get 500,000 people to show up to check out this experience. The challenge is if you use cloud resources, like virtual machines that are providing a GPU, you have a one to one relationship between that server, GPU and the user. The average cost in the market today for cloud resources for that type of experience is one dollar per hour per user. If Nike believes a half a million people that can show up, it would actually have a cost of $500,000 an hour to deliver that experience using the pixel streaming offering in the market today. What we've done with System 76 is build out high power servers with multiple GPUs. Streaming Global has invented a way to have multiple users on a single GPU. We call that GPU Multitenancy. Now instead of only one server and one GPU per user, we actually can support 18 users on a server with two GPU’s, or nine tenants per GPU. That dramatically changes the unit economics so companies that want to provide an immersive, high fidelity photorealistic experience can actually achieve scale. The data doesn't lie in terms of these users getting into these experiences, spending a lot of time looking at a variety of different products. We're working with the Atlanta Braves, as an example. They created a digital twin of their baseball park here in Atlanta. So if I'm a fan, I can run the bases. I can go to Q & A with the front office or maybe some players.

Imagine a car configuration, and as you move around the experience, the lighting and the shading changes with your position. The manufacturer wants it to look as if you're in the showroom. And the only way to effectively accomplish that is to pixel stream thel content. And that's what SG-RT does. It creates the transport from the system 76 server environment, housed at a global footprint of data centers, and then pushes that to the user through just a browser, a mobile device, a VR headset or whatever the end client device would be.",spans:[{start:b,end:663,type:s}],direction:d},{type:a,text:"Where Streaming Global has the Most Impact",spans:[{start:b,end:bl,type:k}],direction:d},{type:a,text:"Brandon: When these kinds of experiences first came about, they were categorized as as part of the metaverse.

And now there are some great experiences that can be built with all of these tools, like Unreal Engine and Unity. There are creative agencies hired by brands to build out this engaging, impressive content. But then how do you best monetize that content? You don't want just something that's engaging, but then you aren’t able to point to how that helps your business. We’re seeing significant activity in the spatial commerce use case.

The manufacturers are doing that in partnership with the owner of Unreal Engine, Epic Games. Instead of going to a website today, and picking my model, color and trim with the site then showing the vehicle in a series flat 2D pictures, now I will be able to go into a virtual showroom. I'm navigating the space, I'm looking at all the different angles. I can step into the car, I can look at the trunk space. This is the spatial commerce use case. There’s also definitely going to continue to be a significant amount of investment in corporate training. When you think about a large employee base, one example is one of our strategic partners is working today is Emirates Airlines. The company has 100,000 employees, and they build out immersive training modules, whether it's for customer service staff or for flight attendants, or it could even be regulated types of training like maintenance or pilots.\nWe were on a call last week where Target stores use Unreal Engine to build store layouts when planning for the next season. You're imagining and curating the customer experience before any physical building begins. A last SG-RT use case is content management. Historically, consumer brands have gone to an internal website and downloaded the color schemes, or approved images and sounds of a particular campaign so they can appropriately label the item.

And then it allows you to take the charts, manifests, the things that deploy that application and then find its configuration as well as its images or repositories or other files that you may need and take all of those things and put it into a single artifact that you can bring with you wherever you need it to be.",spans:[{start:ba,end:702,type:s}],direction:d},{type:K,text:"Zarf's Deployment Capabilities",spans:[],direction:d},{type:a,text:"Wayne: The other thing that it brings, as well as kind of that mirroring capability is it allows you to stand up services on just a Linux machine. So all it needs on the air gap side is just a Linux box. And by default with the init package that we provide, all you need is Linux and system D. And then Zarf can handle the initialization of a k three s cluster, your container registry, a git repository, and then any apps you want to install on top of it. So it can basically light an entire environment from not much. And then you can customize the init package and obviously your own packages as you need for whatever environment you're running in. And if you already have those resources, will be able to use those too. But it's very flexible in kind of how you set up those environments.",spans:[{start:ba,end:792,type:s}],direction:d},{type:K,text:"Importance of Zarf Implementation",spans:[],direction:d},{type:a,text:"Wayne: Basically, it's a lot easier than trying to roll your own way of doing those things. A lot of the things that we focus on are around supply chain security. So there's built in sift software bill materials for the things that brings over. So it'll scan all the images. If you bring over executable files, it'll scan those too, and it'll bring all that stuff together so you don't have to do that manually. It supports package signing with six door cosign so you can have some cryptographic security around the packages you're bringing over. And then we also focus heavily on user experience and making it just a very simple process to create a package, initialize whatever cluster you're deploying into and then deploy packages, basically three commands. So Zarf package create, Zarf init, Zarf package deploy and you have everything up and running. And that's a big difference from rolling your own. A lot of people who are solving this problem, they're doing it with bash scripts or they're trying to manually edit manifests. Just an example of one of the problems you might run into is your image references will be likely pointing to different domains.\nIf you're pulling an image from Docker hub, say Nginx, and then you're trying to bring that over to an air gap, the domain docker hub is not likely to exist there. So how do you rewrite that? A lot of people would manually do that, but Zarf has an agent that it can deploy into the cluster that will handle all that stuff for you. So it does a lot of this sort of behind the scenes work to make what are traditionally online deployments work offline, seamlessly.",spans:[{start:ba,end:hI,type:s},{start:hI,end:hJ,type:s},{start:hJ,end:1625,type:s}],direction:d},{type:K,text:"Platform One and Its Significance",spans:[],direction:d},{type:a,text:"Austen: Platform one is one of the things that's kind of near and dear to my heart. And honestly, several people at defense unicorns in particular. There was a lot of us that were around the inception and idea of that kind of effort taking off. And honestly, it was an effort that was built on the backs of several other, what the department of defense calls software factory efforts like Kessel Run that came before it. And there were others too. But I think it's probably important to start with the problem statement before what it was trying to do. What a lot of us had saw after serving for a decade or so, is that as we went to each stop along our transition to different programs, is that kind of what I mentioned earlier. What was typical is you would kick off the procurement process, which takes a long time in itself to buy something from a vendor, and you would get a blank VPC from Amazon Web services or some bare metal somewhere. And then the idea was, hire a team through a services contract from a known prime contractor and just start building the software from the secure OS layer and up.\nAnd what you realize is that takes 18 months or more to deliver any capability and millions of dollars. And when you look across these programs, now that kind of software has eaten the world. 80% of that tech stack was the exact same software, but it's 30 different vendors recreating the wheel every single time. And it's just an incredible amount of waste when it comes to both time and people's opportunity, cost of their intellectual ability, quite frankly, and also just straight up taxpayer dollars like invoicing and paying bills to these services contracts. And so Platform One, really, the idea of many people coming together was really a self formed team of many people across the country at the time while in active military service. And what we said is like, hey, instead of starting with 5% of a commodity of AWS or whatever else, why don't we try to commoditize like 80% to the tech stack, so that when you start a new program or you're migrating a program to the cloud or whatever it may be, you have 80% of the solution done. It's not 100% right, because there's too much customization kind of at certain layers of the tech stack, but it is 80% maybe instead of five.",spans:[{start:aD,end:hK,type:s},{start:hK,end:hL,type:s},{start:hL,end:2291,type:s}],direction:d},{type:K,text:"Linux Foundation Training Course",spans:[],direction:d},{type:a,text:"Austen: Rob Slaughter, our CEO, did a great job with this.

And that's not a knock against people at all, because the people making decisions are typically experts in business operations or procurement or even like these niche defense missions, right? Like literally putting weapons in a specific location at a specific time, or cyber operations or space operations. It's impossible to expect them to also be highly trained software engineering experts on Kubernetes, for example. And so how do you get them some level of top wave knowledge so that they understand the why behind things? So they can ask the right questions and contract the right products and services. And so what Rob kind of led the initiative was he partnered with Linux foundation to create a completely free course. And the link we had provided to you earlier, and I think it was even in the kind of document you sent out earlier today, so people can look on linuxfoundation.org and just search for \"devsecops for managers\" and it'll come up, it's completely free.\nBut it was really targeted for what I'll call those key stakeholders or decision makers that didn't normally come from a software background but find themselves building or acquiring or developing a system that is software native. And honestly, I think everybody on this call realizes that in today's world, any new endeavor is going to be a software defined endeavor. That's kind of where it starts and ends.

Lula does policy validation, which is useful for a process called authorizing a system and a risk management framework within the Department of Defense, but it's useful for the security compliance side of things.

Converting video formats to different sizes and bitrates can be done with a GUI, but there are also ffmpeg commands to accomplish the same thing.

The hammer comes down, pushes on the metal, and creates a shape in it. Now we're using a brake to create that shape rather than a separate part.

Now it's one piece of metal that goes all the way around and is just formed.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"So we did some things on the internal chassis, like we added a guide on both sides and we added small spacers on the front.
