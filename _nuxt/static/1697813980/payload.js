The hammer comes down, pushes on the metal, and creates a shape in it. Now we're using a brake to create that shape rather than a separate part.

Now it's one piece of metal that goes all the way around and is just formed.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"So we did some things on the internal chassis, like we added a guide on both sides and we added small spacers on the front.
