Being in southeast Alaska, we’re  constrained with what they call off-the-road systems, and the only way  in or out of town is by boat or by plane. So all of our food comes up  here by barge for a small nominal fee, or by aircraft for an incredibly  large fee.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"When I came up to Juneau with my wife and kids 11 years  ago, we noticed that by the time our produce gets up here, it’s lived  on a barge a week, two weeks out of Seattle, and you have no shelf life  left on them. We started trying to grow food within the first year of  getting here, and we came to the conclusion pretty quickly that with 300  days plus of rain every year, outdoor growing wasn’t really a viable  option. That’s when we started a hobby farm in a garage growing some  stuff in soil under fluorescent lights, as odd as that sounds.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"Since  then, we’ve progressed into hydroponics, but we’ve done it very  manually. We go out every other day and take readings by hand, so I’ve  been doing some research about building IOT devices that will talk back  and automate some of the readings. My dream would be using it to  actually control the concentration of nutrient solutions that we use.  The overall goal is we’re going to build the hydroponic monitoring  network of IOT devices, and use the Meerkat  as a control center for the devices and a repository for all the data.  We’ve also been doing some investigating behind the scenes into whether  or not it could grow enough legs to become a business.",spans:[{start:458,end:465,type:h,data:{link_type:i,url:n,target:j}}]},{type:e,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fblog-system76\u002Fc68ff959-e707-4976-a6b1-28917fa86988_tumblr_df6d10523c3cb493637198fe53048bef_55b352d0_500.jpg?auto=compress,format",alt:f,copyright:b,dimensions:{width:g,height:o}},{type:a,text:"Is there a specific type of produce that you’re starting with?",spans:[{start:c,end:62,type:d}]},{type:a,text:"We’ve  been all over the road.

We’ve always got  some kind of green leafy vegetables whether it’s any variety of lettuce  that will grow hydro, some bok choy and tatsoi, and we’re growing kale  like it’s going out of style. We’ve grown cucumbers to the point where I  think I’ve harvested 65 pounds of cucumbers off of 4 plants over the  last couple of months, but we’re really constrained by our size.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"I  live in a relatively small 3-bedroom house, and we’re just using a  one-and-a-half car garage as our grow area. Right now I’ve got two  tents. As funny as it sounds, cannabis is legal in Alaska and has been  forever—my wife and I don’t touch the stuff, but because it’s been  legalized, the infrastructure and the supplies that we need are freely  available. We’re growing tomatoes in a tent that’s designed for  marijuana growth. It works really well. It helps to maintain efficient  temperature control; you can maintain temperature and humidity, block  out extraneous light if you don’t want it, and cycle the lights on and  off.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"Depending on whether it’s too hot in the summer we’ll run the  lights at night, and in the wintertime we’re looking for extra warmth,  we can shift the cycle and run the lights during the day.

You want to keep track of things—your pH  can’t be too acidic or too alkaline, for example.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"The other big  parameter is the electrical conductivity, or total dissolved solids. You  want to make sure you’ve got the right concentration of nutrients, and  that your nutrient solution isn’t salting up. As you’re adjusting pH  back and forth, it’ll start demineralizing salt, so tracking that data  gives you a good indication for when it’s time to dump the reservoir and  start over.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"We’re doing it manually now. I go out every couple of  days and we take samples, and sit down and log it into a spreadsheet.  The Meerkat acts as a control center for programming devices, keeping a  repository of the programming for the IOT devices that we’re using  (Arduinos with the esp8266 chips) as well as running different database  programs as Docker containers, so that they can be spun up and knocked  down fast enough as we try and figure out what the best way to move  forward is.

It’s  astounding what that small form factor and footprint is able to do. I’ve  used Linux for a number of years, and basically everybody’s heard of  System76. I’ve seen Pop!_OS  before and never really played with it all that much, but I’ve actually  grown to love it. The feel, the ergonomics, the interface, and even  down to the color schemes that come bone-stock right out of the box.  They just make more sense to me. I’m looking forward to the COSMIC  update after researching that to see how the differences in the workflow  will affect things.",spans:[{start:236,end:243,type:h,data:{link_type:i,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fpop.system76.com",target:j}}]},{type:e,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fprismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fblog-system76\u002F153695e1-18dd-4a1c-b3b8-f10d8485d27d_tumblr_0b4c4c194cc5c0f80889ef219acf6087_cb311d41_500.jpg",alt:f,copyright:b,dimensions:{width:g,height:o}},{type:a,text:"What software are you using for this project?",spans:[{start:c,end:45,type:d}]},{type:a,text:"Right  now we’re writing in Docker containers and running the Tick Stack from  Influx.

I’ve got a  pretty small workbench at our shop here in Juneau, so using the Meerkat  to drive all of our test equipment to control the radio while logging  data coming out of the radio, it was perfect. It had enough horsepower  to remotely control the test equipment. I wasn’t pushing it all that  hard, but setting it up and going back and forth between having it at  home or at work, it was negligible to get it up and running.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"Stay tuned for further updates from Ben Ruel’s Garage Garden and cool projects from our other UYPP winners!",spans:[{start:c,end:107,type:"em"}]}]},id:"post_copy$a06822ab-05a9-4195-afc4-c222867f7284",slice_type:"post_copy",slice_label:b}],socialText:b,socialLinks:[{link:{}}],seoTitle:k,seoDescription:l,seoSocial:[{image:{dimensions:{width:1200,height:600},alt:b,copyright:b,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fblog-system76\u002Fe882aafb-2b7b-408a-931e-4111c5a7545f_tumblr_dd7041fa26edd803e3e5f3ec576f1a1a_4e321f6b_500.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,12,500,250&w=1200&h=600"},title:k,description:l}]}},_img:{}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("paragraph",null,0,"strong","image","Image",500,"hyperlink","Web","_blank","UYPP: Ben Ruel’s Garage Garden","Back in March, we announced the winners for our Unleash Your Potential Program, in which six participants got to configure their own System76 computer to use for their awesome projects.","uypp-ben-ruels-garage-garden","https:\u002F\u002Fsystem76.com\u002Fdesktops\u002Fmeerkat",333)));
