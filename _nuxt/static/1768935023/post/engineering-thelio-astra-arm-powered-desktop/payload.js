There was also a test for computational fluid dynamics where it performed in the 99th percentile.\nThere's some tests that even ray tracing it was in the 94th percentile, so it's performing really well.

So we made our cpu duct a little bit larger, so it had a larger intake, so that more airflow would get to the cooler, and allow it to cool the cpu more efficiently. And we also made some modifications to the rear exhaust fan, and the modifications allowed it to prevent recirculation of hot air and make sure all the air exits the rear of the chassis.

So that itself required some modifications for just the cpu ducting. And that allowed the cooling of the system to be a lot more efficient and stay at a lower operating temperature. That’s the main part to really accommodate the cpu. And everything else is really accommodating for the larger cooler. And with the larger cooler, there's more heat transfer, and therefore we need a little bit better airflow along with that. So that required a more efficient ducting system for the rear fan to prevent any kind of air recirculation.

As far as drives, nothing too specific there. Our test system that we've been running in the factory has been using 64 gig modules, which has given us plenty of memory to run tests. We actually just started running a test running a bunch of vms, and we just got the results in on that. And some of these things are software specific as far as the versions and images we're using for Ubuntu, and those are things that are still currently being tested. So far, the performance is looking really good.
