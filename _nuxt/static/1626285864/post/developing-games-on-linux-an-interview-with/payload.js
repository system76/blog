And that‚Äôs nice‚Äîunless you‚Äôre us, in which case that‚Äôs just frustrating and awful. But I would say that usually the Linux builds have fewer stability issues. I would encourage developers to generally use a mix of OSes in their pipeline really early on in development, because you can catch some real weird behavior that way before it‚Äôs too late.
